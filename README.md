Part 1:
My role in my GDW group is a Developer
I plan on contributing code relating to units in the game and resorces (ex in game materials, spending materials)

Part 2:
In the first tutorial we start the scene by adding the player with anamtions, controls and scripts. 
I learned how to use the input actions to map keys to interactions and map controllers to unity.
I also learned how to make the camera follow the player by having the camera be a child of the player.
The most important thing I learned was how to use the input actions in scripts, using the input actions is easier than the pervious ways of making players move so this was the most important part of the tutorial for me.

Part 3:
In the second tutorial we worked on adding bullets, jump, score and using public variables with public functions.
Learning how to add bullets in the game was important as being able to create materials with values (ex velocity, force) is useful.
Also learning how to make the player jump and limit the amount of times they can jump by creating a function that detects when the player is on the ground.
The most important thing I learned was how to use public functions in diffrent scripts, this may have been one of the easier things to learn but is very important as it makes coding faster and easier.
